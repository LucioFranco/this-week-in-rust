# Crate of the Week

This week's Crate of the Week is Kerosene2000's [reustmann](https://crates.io/crates/reustmann) a Von-Neumann Architecture written in Rust.
This is presumably useful as a base substrate to train genetic algorithms on. Thanks, Kerosene2000!

[Submit your suggestions for next week][submit_crate]!
