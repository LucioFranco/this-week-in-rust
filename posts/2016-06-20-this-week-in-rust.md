# Crate of the Week

This week's Crate of the Week is [error-chain](https://crates.io/crates/error-chain) which feels like the missing piece in Rust's `Result`-based error-handling puzzle. Thanks to [KodrAus](https://users.rust-lang.org/users/KodrAus) for the suggestion.

[Submit your suggestions for next week][submit_crate]!

* [The pretty-printer will now `try!` again instead of questioning](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/34312) (since `?` isn't stable, this eases backporting)
* MIR drop handling got a little easier by [caching in some cases](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/34307) and [dropping less](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/34290)
* [`-Z dump_mir` now writes parent- and promoted MIR to different files](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/34306)

## Approved RFCs

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments)

Every week [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the
'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs which are reaching a
decision. Express your opinions now. [This week's FCPs][fcp] are:
