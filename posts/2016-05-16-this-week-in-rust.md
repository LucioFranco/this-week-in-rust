# Crate of the Week

This week's Crate of the Week is [cargo-profiler](https://github.com/pegasos1/cargo-profiler), which lets us profile our code directly from cargo using a variety of tools, notably valgrind's callgrind and cachegrind. Thanks to [kbknapp](https://users.rust-lang.org/users/kbknapp) for the suggestion!

[Submit your suggestions for next week][submit_crate]!
